# Gradient Descent Learning Project

## Overview

This project explores the concept of **Gradient Descent**, a fundamental optimization algorithm used in machine learning and statistics. The goal is to minimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) by iteratively adjusting the slope and intercept of a linear model. This repository contains code that provides a visual representation of the gradient descent process using the OpenCV library.

## Repository Structure

The code for this project is organized as follows:

```
ML-Math-Concepts/
└── Gradient Descent/
    ├── app.py
    ├── algos
        └── gradient_descent.py
    └── README.md
```

- **app.py**: Contains the implementation of the gradient descent algorithm and visual representations.
- **plot_visualization.py**: Generates visualizations of MSE, slope, and intercept during the gradient descent process.
- **README.md**: This file.

## Key Features

- **Gradient Descent Algorithm**: Implementation of the gradient descent optimization technique.
- **Visual Representation**: Uses OpenCV to visualize the convergence of MSE, as well as the changes in slope and intercept values.
- **Interactive Visuals**: Visual outputs help in understanding how gradient descent iteratively approaches the optimal solution.

## Getting Started

To run the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
